        <p>王粲：士同风于朝，农同业于野，虽官职务殊，地气异宜，然其致功成利，未有相害而不通者也。古者八岁入小学，学六甲五方书计之事。十五入大学，学君臣朝廷王事之纪，则文法典艺，具存于此矣。至乎末世，则不然矣。执法之吏，不窥先王之典，绅之儒，不通律令之要。彼刀笔之吏，岂生而察刻哉，起于几案之下，长于官曹之间，无温裕文雅以自润，虽欲无察刻，弗能得矣。竹帛之儒，岂生而迂缓也？起于讲堂之上，游于乡校之中，无严猛断割以自裁，虽欲不迂缓，弗能得矣。先王见其如此也。是以博陈其教，辅和民性，达其所壅，祛其所蔽，吏服雅训，儒通文法，故能宽猛相济，刚柔自克也。 「儒吏论」</p>

        <p>父亲的話悠然縈繞在耳際，這些話從我從杭州落地到今，已經不止一次聽說:在匯T樓的一層的小屋裡、在金融學院的操場間、在小區的小徑上。一切都和教養有關，一切離養兒大後的不甘心不遠。他老了，心也寒了。</p>

        <p>Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) promoted and popularized Charles Darwin (1809-1882) Racial rioting in the US from 1964-71 Inconcient hypnotique , Crowd, mass, public, excessive sentiments Preparatory (remote) factors: race, traditions, time, political and social institutions, institution and education Immediate factors: images-words-and-formula, illusions, experience, reason (trivially) Leader: means of persuasion, affirmation-repetition-contagious (ideas, sentiments, emotions, and beliefs possess in crowds a contagious power) [To exaggerate, to affirm, to resort to repetitions, and never to attempt to prove anything by reasoning are methods of argument well known to speakers at public meetings. P.35] Crowds exhibit a docile respect for force, and are but slightly impressed by kindness, which for them is scarcely other than a form of weakness. ….. A crowd is always ready to revolt against a feeble and to bow down servilely before a strong authority. P. 38-39 A long time is necessary for ideas to establish themselves in the minds of crowds, but just as long a time is needed for them to eradicated. P.51 The power of conquerors and the strength of states is based on the popular imagination……. All great historical facts, the rise of Buddhism, of Christianity, of Islamist, the Reformation, the French Revolution, and, in our own time, the threatening invasion of Socialism are the direct or indirect consequences of strong impression produced on the imagination of the crowd. P.56 [It is not, then, the facts in themselves that strike the popular imagination, but the way in which they take place and are brought under notice, …….To know the art of impressing the imagination of crowds is to know at the same time the art of governing them. P.58] All founders of religious or political creeds have established them solely because they were successful in inspiring crowds with those fanatical sentiments which have as result that men find their happiness in worship and obedience and are ready to lay down their lives for their idol. P.61 Political and social organizations are works that demand centuries. P. 75 by M. Lavisse<br/>
Many eminent philosophers, among them Herbert Spencer, have hand no difficulty in showing that instruction neither renders a man more moral nor happier, that it changes neither his instincts nor his hereditary passions, and that at times- for this to happen it need only be badly directed- it is much more pernicious than useful. P. 81 It is seen, then, that the same word which signifies for one people the subordination of the will and the initiative of the individual and the preponderance of the State, signifies for the another the excessive development of the will and the initiative of the individual and the complete subordination of the State. P.103 The social illusion reigns today upon all the heaped-up ruins of the past, and to it belongs the future. The masses have never thirsted after truth. They turn aside from evidence that is not to their taste, preferring to deify error, if error seduce them. P.105 A crowd is servile flocks that is incapable of ever doing without a master. …..two classes of leader… The one includes the men who are energetic and possess, but only intermittently, much strength of will, the other the men, far rarer than the preceding, whose strength of will is enduring. ( a strong and continuous will) P. 117 Prestige: Acquired or artificial prestige is much the most common. The mere fact that an individual occupies a certain position, possesses a certain fortune, or bears certain titles, endows him with prestige, however slight him own personal worth. (Two principal head, acquired prestige and personal prestige) P.128 Great permanent beliefs, In the second place, there are the transitory, changing opinions, the out come as a rule, of general conceptions , of which every age sees the birth and disappearance; examples in point are the theories which mound literature and the arts- those, for instance, which produced romanticism, naturalism, mysticism, etc. P.142</p>

    <p>Posted on 2019-03-07</p>
        <p>徹夜未眠，讀完了「房思琪的初戀樂園」。去年即看了作者關於本書的採訪，但一直沒時間看，期間多次看了#METOO、Japan’s Secret Shame; 近來聽「針尖」podcast才重燃興趣。這是一篇令人絕望、震撼的關於少女內心世界觀照的文藝作品。房/許/郭/劉被折磨（尤是精神）的痛苦，實虐者逍遙在外繼續施虐，受虐者從總體數量和個體深度上卻彷彿沒有結尾，赤裸的結局，如袒露的「犢羊」。句號不是句號，而是一口口不見底的深井，在社會/制度/人文/政治共同維護、自欺中，誘引「貪婪的看井人」一次又次推下她們年輕的瓷白。而井裡的人，在自我厭棄中被雙方的語言催眠，愛/崇拜著一個施虐暴徒。旋轉，旋轉在井窩中，喊不出聲，用不上力。</p>
