        <p>父亲的話悠然縈繞在耳際，這些話從我從杭州落地到今，已經不止一次聽說:在匯T樓的一層的小屋裡、在金融學院的操場間、在小區的小徑上。一切都和教養有關，一切離養兒大後的不甘心不遠。他老了，心也寒了。</p>

    <p>Posted on 2019-02-03</p>
        <p>In adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which, however, I was restrained by the desire to know more mathematics. Now, on the contrary, I enjoy life; I might almost say that with every year that passes I enjoy it more. This is due partly to having discovered what were the things that I most desired, and having gradually acquired many of these things. Partly it is due to having successfully dismissed certain objects of desire - such as the acquisition of indubitable knowledge about something or other — as essentially unattainable. But very largely it is due to a diminishing preoccupation with myself. Like others who had a Puritan education, I had the habit of meditating on my sins, follies, and shortcomings. I seemed to myself — no doubt justly — a miserable specimen. Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to centre my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection. -The Conquest of Happiness (1930) is a book by Bertrand Russell.</p>

        <p>夏目漱石的「心」：一部書的偉大不只是在于他主題的獨特性，而更在於于讀者心中激起的波瀾。こゝろ的深刻之處恰在于語言中夾帶的隱藏和深刻。重讀本書，才发現原先被情節吸引，此時則更能看到未言之處。</p>
