Welcome to my space. 

Xiaowei is a Ph.D. candidate (started at Sep. 2017) in fluid mechanics under the supervision of [Prof. Richard Sanberg](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/742813-richard-sandberg) at the [Unimelb Fluid Mechanics Group](https://fluids.eng.unimelb.edu.au/).

I received a MPhil. in Bridge Engineering from Tongji University (同濟) supervised by [Prof. Yaojun Ge](https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/Data/View/279) and [Prof. Yongxin Yang](https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/Data/View/285) in 2017. Before that, I completed a B.Sc in Civil Engineering from Hunan University (嶽麓) under the supervision of Prof. Zhi Fang in 2013.

I am interested in turbulence modelling, machine learning, and bridges and wind turbines. I am fond of reading books about history, philosophy and films.
